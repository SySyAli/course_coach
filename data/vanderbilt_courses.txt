DIV7119 - Models of Interfaith EngagementThe contemporary “interfaith” sector is expanding exponentially as more organizations, persons, andgovernments realize the importance of constructive engagement among diverse “religious” traditions. This course maps major models of interfaith engagement (e.g., dialogue, faith-based diplomacy/peacebuilding, service leadership, organizing, etc.) and equips students with the practical and social ethical knowledge needed to be an interfaith leader in varied institutional spaces (e.g., congregations, non-profits, social movements, universities, chaplaincy, and government). With an eye to analysis of power, conflict, and ethical potential, we explore specific historical and contemporary case studies such as the Parliament of World Religions (beginning in 1863); the Black Freedom movement and Black Muslims in the 1950s and 1960s; the Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican in the 1960s; and the rise of service leadership and community organizing models in the last fifty years in the living wage campaigns, broad-based organizing, and Movements for Black Lives. We engage the emerging field of literature on the interfaith movement, particularly in the U.S., along with questions addressing the categories of “religion” and “secularism” in interfaith movements.

HODL3284 - Gender and LeadershipWhat does the research on leadership tell us? Broad based leadership research has examined leadership by gender (Eagly & Carli, 2007; Gage, Mumma, & Fritz, 2004), feminine and masculine characteristics of leadership (Eagly & Carli, 2007; Pittinsky, Bacon, & Welle, 2007; Valian, 1998), and perceptions of women’s ability to lead (Rhode & Kellerman, 2007). Yet much leadership research has typically addressed leadership development from a traditional view: white, male, positional leadership. How can we bring about a shift in the view of leaders and leadership? What role does and can gender identity play in effective approaches to leadership? In what ways can we learn to problematize situations and develop solutions through more contemporary leadershipapproaches? Utilizing research, popular readings, and voices from leaders from various gender identities, this course will examine the theoretical perspectives of leadership and gender. Exploration of one’s view of self-as-leader including gender identity, will also be incorporated.
