## Key Features

- **Interactive Flowcharts**: Visualize academic progress, showing prerequisite chains and completed courses to help students stay on track.
- **Course Prerequisite Mapping**: Easily map out the courses needed for advanced coursework.
- **Course Input**: Students can input their completed courses, and the app will automatically update their progress.
- **AI Advisor**: The integrated AI recommends future courses based on the studentâ€™s history, ensuring no prerequisites or requirements are missed.

## How It Works
CourseCoach was built using:
- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and API integration.
- **TypeScript** for type safety and developer experience.
- **Chakra UI** for a clean, responsive, and component-driven design.
- **ChatGPT API** to power the AI Advisor, providing personalized course recommendations based on academic history.

## Challenges
The most significant challenge was integrating the ChatGPT API and fine-tuning the responses to provide accurate course recommendations. It was also our first experience working with the ChatGPT API, adding a learning curve to the project.

## Accomplishments
- Developed an interactive and visually appealing course flowchart tool.
- Successfully integrated AI-powered course recommendations.
- Built a scalable platform capable of handling degree requirements across multiple universities.

## Future Plans
- **Expansion**: Extend support to other universities by using PDF parsing and NLP to pull course data from various catalogs.
- **Enhanced AI**: Incorporate sentiment analysis from course reviews to offer more personalized recommendations.
- **Improved Interactivity**: Allow students to drag and drop courses into their schedule and see the impact on their graduation timeline.
- **Collaborative Features**: Enable students to share their planned schedules with peers or advisors for feedback.
